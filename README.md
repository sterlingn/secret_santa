## Do you need to throw names in a hat in order to figure out who has who for a gift exchange?
## Are your participants in different cities, countries, or otherwise can meet in person to do the old picking out the name from the hat?

If either of these answers is yes, you've come to the right place. This code MirChamb3r has put together in python, will iterate through 
the different participants and match them to someone else (no same person picking). MirChamb3r added the option to send the email itself or to print 
the selections to a folder, and then you can send the files out based on the names written on each file.
